# SQL for Data Analysis - Udacity

Towards the end of 2018 I found myself back on the job market. Having failed to make the mark on a couple of SQL live assessment (I hate those with passion by the way!), I knew that I needed a SQL refresher, pronto!

After sampling a few courses, I landed on one of __Udacity__'s free courses, [__SQL for Data Analysis__](https://www.udacity.com/course/sql-for-data-analysis--ud198), which did not disappoint! 

Like the vast majority of Udacity's products I checked, the content is of very high quality. It starts from the SQL basics (great to brush up your SELECT, FROM, and WHERE), progresses with JOINS and AGGREGATIONS and concludes with Window Functions, which most intermediate and some advanced courses do not even mention. The only minor drawback is that they do NOT provide a completion certificate, unless you take this as part of one of their Nanodegrees or paid-for courses!

When taking online classes, I like to combine the original code they provide with my own comments, bits of the video lesson voice overs, and the questions and solutions from the frequent quizzes they use to check on your progress. I find this a very useful exercise that helps me to fix important concepts and intuitions that I may not utilise right away. And I know that I can go back to my notes every time I have a doubt. 

Fast forward to 2022, I finally decided to sort out the annotated codes from the classes and store them on my personal GitHub page so that they are always there when I need them!
